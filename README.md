# Google-Cloud-Projects
Welcome to this repository showing my Google Cloud Projects. In these projects i got practical experience working in the cloud environment using tools like Bigquery and SQL to transform data. Tools like Dataplex were used for external data sourcing. I also used tools like Looker to analyze data and build Dashboard visualizations. I used LOOKML to create visualization-as-a-code; which enables creation of custome visualizations, completing of complex calculations, and enabling better collaboration through data modeling. 

The cloud computing and data analytical skills i gained from these projects have enhanced my capacity to work with big data using cutting edge tools in the cloud environment.  

## Task/Project List

Here's an overview of the near real life projects I worked on during my training with Google Clout Data Analytics Certification:

## Project 1
In this project, i used LOOKER to built a Loan Insight intaractive dashboard containing 4 visualizations. I also applied cross filtering and automatic refreshing attributes to the visualizations.
