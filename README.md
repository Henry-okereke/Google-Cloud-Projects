# Google-Cloud-Projects
Welcome to this repository showing my Google Cloud Projects. In these projects i got practical experience working in the cloud environment using tools like Bigquery and SQL to transform data. Tools like Dataplex were used for external data sourcing. I also used tools like Looker to analyze data and build Dashboard visualizations. I used LOOKML to create visualization-as-a-code; which enables creation of custome visualizations, completing of complex calculations, and enabling better collaboration through data modeling. 

The cloud computing and data analytical skills i gained from these projects have enhanced my capacity to work with big data using cutting edge tools in the cloud environment.  

## Task List

Here's an overview of the tasks or projects I worked on during my internship:

## Task 1
The first project is the Analysis of a Telemetry Data; where i used Tableau to analyze the data and built a dashboard of two charts; using the first chat as a filter to the second chat.

The dashboard view below shows the filter in play.
